## Connecting to the repository and uploading the project

This guide will help you open the terminal, connect to a GitHub repository, and download the project locally on your computer. When I first started working with Git, it was difficult for me to find information that was useful to me personally. Therefore, I decided to make my own detailed checklist on how to upload projects. 

### 1. Open the Terminal

- **On macOS**: Press `Command + Space`, type **Terminal**.
- **On Windows**: Press `Win + R`, type **cmd** or **PowerShell**.
